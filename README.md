## Mapbox Basemap

Mapbox basemap [I created][] was inspired by the changing colors of the trees around us here in Corvallis. I wanted to use a warm color palette to render the various colors of leaves. The detailed, curly Gothic fonts chosen were to be evoke a Halloween aesthetic. My favorite part of the map is the various shades of green and yellow present in the topography.
